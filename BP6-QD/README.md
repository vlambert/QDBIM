This is a simple quasi-dynamic boundary element code for performing 2D antiplane simulations of sequences of earthquakes and aseismic slip (SEAS) utilizing Runge-Kutta 4/5 adaptive time-stepping to solve for the time history evolution of slip and stress.

The two files are set up to solve benchmark problems BP6-QD-A and BP6-QD-S from the Statewide California Earthquake Center Working Group for Advancing Simulations of Earthquakes and Aseismic Slip: https://strike.scec.org/cvws/seas/benchmark_descriptions.html.

The problems consider the simulation of an aseismic slip transient that is induced by pore pressure changes consistent with fluid injection into the fault as well as along-fault pore fluid diffusion. The problems consider a velocity-strengthening fault with different evolution of the rate-and-state friction coefficient following the aging (BP6-QD-A) and slip (BP6-QD-S) laws.
