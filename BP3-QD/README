This is a simple quasi-dynamic boundary element code for performing 2D plane strain simulations of sequences of earthquakes and aseismic slip (SEAS) utilizing Runge-Kutta 4/5 adaptive time-stepping to solve for the time history evolution of slip and stress.

The three files are set up to solve benchmark problems BP-3 for fault dips of 30, 60 and 90 degrees from the Statewide California Earthquake Center Working Group for Advancing Simulations of Earthquakes and Aseismic Slip: https://strike.scec.org/cvws/seas/benchmark_descriptions.html.

The problems consider the simulation of sequences of earthquakes and aseismic slip transient on a dipping thrust fault.
